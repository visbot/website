# THE VISBOT ARCHIVE

Here you can find many of the popular AVS packs from various artists. [AVS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Visualization_Studio) is a plugin that comes by default with [Winamp](http://winamp.com). Most of these come with the original installers created by the artists, others are marked *unofficial* which simply means it's an archive containing a folder of presets (required files such as bitmaps might be missing!).

## Installation

Most of the files were compressed using the 7-zip format. These archives can be uncompressed with [7-zip]([7-zip](http://7-zip.org), [WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/) and a couple of other programs. Other files have the `.pimp extension, which requires the [PimpBot Runtime](http://whyeye.org/projects/pimpbot/) to install them. Links to the mentioned programs can be found below.

The contents of the files differs and has not been tested on any kind of malware or missing files. Installers created by the original authors have been left un- changed.

## Contribute
